 *
 *  \brief  This application uses a GPIO pin to blink the LED.
 *
 *          Application Configurations:
 *
 *              Modules Used:
 *                  GPIO1
 *
 *              Configuration Parameters:
 *                  None
 *
 *          Application Use Case:
 *              1) The GPIO pin GPIO1[23] is used as an output pin.
 *              2) This pin is alternately driven HIGH and LOW. A finite delay
 *                 is given to retain the pin in its current state.
 *
 *          Running the example:
 *              On running the example, the LED on beaglebone would be seen 
 *              turning ON and OFF alternatively.
